# Implementation of a Differential Fault Analysis Attack against DES

ChiffreFaux contains cyphertexts that have been faulted on the last round of DES.
The clairEtChiffreJuste.txt file, contains the cleartext along with the good cyphertext. 
We are using the faulted cyphers to find the key back (see the code & tutorial in the notebook).
