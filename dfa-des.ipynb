    "### What is differential fault analysis ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential fault analysis or DFA is a cryptanalysis technique that works with most modern cyphers. The idea is that you can't bruteforce the cypher and get the key because there are just too much possibilities. However, if you can inject a fault (which basically means flipping one bit during the execution of the algorithm), it will propagate and you might be able to retrieve valuable information and then deduce the secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could inject such faults with various techniques such as targeting a chip's memory with a laser or inducing variations in the electric current it recieves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are we going to do exactly ?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to learn DFA with DES. DES stands for Data Encryption Standard. It was the standard encryption algorithm before AES was invented. It uses a 56 bits key size, which means that nowadays one could bruteforce it pretty easily.\n",
    "However 3DES is still in use, which consists of applying DES three times. It has a complexity of 2^112 and is still used.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is the plan :\n",
    "* First we'll learn how DES works\n",
    "* Then we'll implement it (you need a DES implementation in order to perform a DFA anyways)\n",
    "* Then we'll attack the key throught DFA !\n",
    "\n",
    "All the implementations will be done in Python, so I recommend you have a minimal understanding of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's go\n",

    "## How DES Works\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with a bit of theory : we first need to understand DES's functionning.\n",
    "\n",
    "I said earlier that DES uses a 56 bits keysize. That is not exactly right : DES uses a 64 bits keysize, but eight of those bits are just parity bits : they are not used during the computation and are here to verify the key isn't corrupted. \n",
    "This brings down the key size to 56 bits, meaning a bruteforce attaque would have a complexity of 2^56. This is a lot but largely realistic nowadays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a scheme of what DES does :\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](des.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem overwhelming if you've never done any crypto before but you will see it's a pretty simple design. \n",
    "DES belongs to the family of the *Feistel cyphers*. It means you can draw it as a twisted ladder, as you can see above. One of their main interests aside from their simplicity is that there is only one algorithm for cyphering and decyphering: the key doesn't change, nor does the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B: all the permutations described below are hardcoded in the algorithm and are part of the standard. We won't detail the way they are built, but they are meant to optimize the security. If you want to see all the constants somewhere else, I'd recommend wikipedia : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantes_du_DES\n",
    "\n",
    "What DES basically does is :\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, it takes a 64 bits message and applies an initial permutation (IP) to it, which just modifies the order of the bits\n",
    "* Then the main algorithm starts: cut the message in two halves, L0 and R0.\n",
    "* Derive a subkey K1, of 48 bits from the original key of 56 bits\n",
    "* Apply a function f (we'll see exactly what it does when implementing it) for *cyphering R0 with K1*\n",
    "* Xor all this to the left part of the message (L0). This will become the right part of the message for the next step (R1)\n",
    "* R0 becomes the left part of our new message (R1)\n",
    "* Apply this transformation until reaching a message L16, R16, then the message will be cyphered\n",
    "* Finally you need to revert the permutation IP you did in the beginning, so apply IP^-1 to your message L16|R16\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short, what the algorithm does each step is to compute : Li+1 = Ri and Ri+1 = Li xor f(Ki, Ri), with Ki being derivated from the original key K**"

This means we first need to  compute PC2-1(K16) with PC2-1 being the inverse permutation of PC2. The output will be 56 bits, 8 of which are lost (kind of the same problem as with the SBox, we are trying to find 56 bits from 48 bits : some of the information has been lost).  \n",
